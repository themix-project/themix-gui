### Manual installation

First, you need to compile the theme using the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) compiler.

To install Sass, install Ruby and the gem command using your distribution's package manager. Then install `sass` with the `gem` command,

`gem install sass`

You'll also need the following commands in your path to generate the gresource binary. Install them using your distribution's package manager.

* `glib-compile-schemas`
* `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata`

After installing all the dependencies, switch to the cloned directory and, run the following in Terminal,

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

To set the theme in GNOME, run the following commands in Terminal,

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Numix"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Numix"
```

To set the theme in Xfce, run the following commands in Terminal,

```sh
xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Numix"
xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s "Numix"
```

### For contributors
Start by reviewing the [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-gtk-theme/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### For developers
If you want to hack on the theme, make sure you have the `inotifywait` command available, which is used for watching and automatically building the files.

To start watching for changes, run the following,

```sh
make watch
```

If you change any assets, you'll need to regenerate the `gtk.gresource.xml` and `gtk.gresource` files. You can use [grrr](https://github.com/satya164/grrr) to do it easily.
